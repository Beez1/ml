Machine Learning 
Assignment 21 
40% of the module 
Due on Sunday 27/04 at 23:59 
Task 1 (30%) 
You should do a literature review on the following topic:  
Soil type identification using satellite images 
In this task you should use recent references that address this topic, you will need to compare 
the various sources and contrast the approaches and the results and finally to reflect on the 
overall findings. 
Submission: 
1. Documentation (2-3 pages) 
 
Task 2 (70%) 
In this task you will use Deep Learning (DL) to perform a task of your choice (classification, 
regression, sequence prediction). Your task should involve using a DL model that we studied in 
this course (MLP, CNN, RNN, ...) 
Notes: 
- You need to select a dataset that will lend itself to a good understanding. 
- The identified problem should be of a real application. 
- Chosen dataset should be challenging and still under investigation. 
Submission: 
1. Python code (notebook) for your working (it should show your outputs) 
2. Documentation which should describe all your working, approaches and justifications 
(use figures, tables, code snippets as appropriate)  
Marking scheme: 
Data Exploration and Pre-
processing 
20% Data analysis/cleaning, handling data quality 
issues (if any) 
Task (classifier, regression, ..) 
development and testing 
40% Model selection, training, optimisation, and 
evaluation (including results) 
Documentation 40% It should not exceed 10 pages. It should have 
introduction with related work, discussion of the 
data, justification for the chosen model, discussion 
on developing, training, testing and evaluating the 
model. Discussion of the results.
