# Task 2: CNN-Based Classification for Soil Type Identification

## 1. Introduction & Related Work
Land cover and soil type classification using satellite imagery plays a critical role in environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and urban planning. This study implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify various land cover types, including soil, vegetation, and water bodies, from satellite imagery.

The classification of land cover and soil types from satellite imagery presents several challenges. These include spectral similarities between classes, mixed pixels containing multiple land cover types, seasonal variations affecting surface appearances, and the influence of atmospheric conditions on image quality. Deep learning approaches, particularly CNNs, have demonstrated promising results in addressing these challenges by automatically extracting hierarchical features from raw imagery.

As highlighted in the literature review (Task 1), recent studies have shown the effectiveness of CNNs for soil and land cover classification. For instance, Tao et al. (2022) achieved 83% accuracy for soil type classification using Sentinel-2 imagery, while Liu et al. (2022) demonstrated the value of attention mechanisms in CNNs for capturing spatial context in soil mapping. Building on these insights, this study implements a CNN architecture optimized for land cover classification from RGB satellite imagery.

The dataset used in this study consists of 10 distinct land cover classes: AnnualCrop, Forest, HerbaceousVegetation, Highway, Industrial, Pasture, PermanentCrop, Residential, River, and SeaLake. While not exclusively focused on soil types, this diverse set of classes enables the model to distinguish between different land surfaces, including various agricultural soil uses (annual crops, permanent crops, pasture) and natural land cover types.

The objectives of this implementation are to:
1. Develop a CNN model capable of accurately classifying land cover types from RGB satellite imagery
2. Compare the performance of different CNN architectures and hyperparameters
3. Analyze the model's feature extraction capabilities through visualization techniques
4. Assess the model's generalization ability across different land cover classes
5. Identify opportunities for improving land cover classification using deep learning approaches

This work contributes to the growing body of research on applying deep learning to remote sensing data and demonstrates the potential of CNNs for automated land cover mapping from satellite imagery.

## 2. Data Description & Pre-processing
### Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this study consists of satellite imagery patches representing 10 distinct land cover classes. Each image is a 64x64 pixel RGB patch extracted from larger satellite scenes. The dataset contains a total of 27,000 images distributed across the classes as follows:
- AnnualCrop: 3,000 images
- Forest: 3,000 images
- HerbaceousVegetation: 3,000 images
- Highway: 2,500 images
- Industrial: 2,500 images
- Pasture: 2,000 images
- PermanentCrop: 2,500 images
- Residential: 3,000 images
- River: 2,500 images
- SeaLake: 3,000 images

This distribution shows a slight class imbalance, with Pasture having the fewest examples (2,000) and several classes having the maximum of 3,000 examples. The dataset appears to be derived from the EuroSAT dataset (Helber et al., 2019), which consists of Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 spectral bands and focusing on land use and land cover classification across Europe.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Visual inspection of the images reveals clear differences between the classes, though some similarities exist between related categories. For example:
- AnnualCrop and PermanentCrop images show agricultural patterns but differ in texture and regularity
- Forest and HerbaceousVegetation both appear green but with different textures and densities
- River and SeaLake both represent water bodies but differ in shape and surrounding context
- Residential and Industrial areas show built environments with different densities and patterns

All images are RGB with consistent dimensions (64x64 pixels) and color range (0-255). No missing data or corrupted images were identified during the initial exploration. The relatively small image size (64x64) provides sufficient context for classification while keeping computational requirements manageable.

### Preprocessing Steps
#### Resizing and Normalization
Although the images are already consistently sized at 64x64 pixels, normalization is essential for efficient training of neural networks. Each image is normalized by dividing all pixel values by 255, rescaling them to the range [0,1]. This normalization improves training stability and convergence by ensuring that all input features have similar ranges.

#### Data Augmentation
To enhance model robustness and reduce overfitting, particularly for classes with fewer examples, the following data augmentation techniques are applied during training:
- Random rotation (±20 degrees)
- Width and height shifts (±20%)
- Shear transformations (±20%)
- Zoom variations (±20%)
- Horizontal flips

These augmentations create realistic variations in the training data, simulating different viewing angles, scales, and positions that might occur in real-world satellite imagery. Importantly, augmentations are applied on-the-fly during training, effectively expanding the training dataset without increasing storage requirements.

#### Train/Validation/Test Split
The dataset is divided into three subsets:
- Training set (70%): Used to train the model parameters
- Validation set (10%): Used for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping
- Test set (20%): Used only for final evaluation to provide an unbiased assessment of model performance

The splitting is performed using stratified sampling to maintain the original class distribution in each subset, ensuring that less represented classes like Pasture have proportional representation across all sets. Random seeds are set for reproducibility of the splits.

Before training, we verified that the preprocessing pipeline correctly handles the images and that the resulting data distribution is appropriate for model training. The class distribution visualization confirmed that the stratified splitting maintained proper class proportions across all subsets.

## 3. Model Architecture & Justification
### CNN Architecture Selection
For this land cover classification task, we implemented a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed to balance performance, computational efficiency, and the risk of overfitting. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features through convolutional layers, pooling operations, and non-linear activations.

The architecture design was guided by several considerations:
1. The relatively small input size (64x64 pixels) limits the depth of the network
2. The complexity of distinguishing between 10 land cover classes requires sufficient representational capacity
3. The limited training data (approximately 1,900-2,100 images per class after train/validation split) necessitates regularization to prevent overfitting
4. The need for computational efficiency to enable experimentation with different hyperparameters

### Layer-by-Layer Explanation
The final CNN architecture consists of three convolutional blocks followed by fully connected layers:

#### Input Layer
- Input shape: (64, 64, 3) representing RGB images

#### Convolutional Block 1
- Conv2D: 32 filters with 3×3 kernel size, ReLU activation
- BatchNormalization: Normalizes activations to improve training stability
- MaxPooling2D: 2×2 pooling window, reducing spatial dimensions to 32×32

#### Convolutional Block 2
- Conv2D: 64 filters with 3×3 kernel size, ReLU activation
- BatchNormalization: Normalizes activations
- MaxPooling2D: 2×2 pooling window, reducing spatial dimensions to 16×16

#### Convolutional Block 3
- Conv2D: 128 filters with 3×3 kernel size, ReLU activation
- BatchNormalization: Normalizes activations
- MaxPooling2D: 2×2 pooling window, reducing spatial dimensions to 8×8

#### Fully Connected Layers
- Flatten: Converts the 3D feature maps (8×8×128) to a 1D vector
- Dropout (0.5): Randomly sets 50% of inputs to zero during training for regularization
- Dense: 256 units with ReLU activation
- Dropout (0.3): Additional regularization with 30% dropout rate
- Dense (Output): 10 units with softmax activation, producing class probabilities

### Design Decisions and Rationale
Several key design decisions were made based on empirical testing and established best practices:

#### Increasing Filter Complexity
The number of filters doubles in each successive convolutional block (32 → 64 → 128), allowing the network to learn increasingly complex features while keeping the parameter count manageable. This approach is supported by the observation that deeper layers typically detect more abstract features, requiring greater representational capacity.

#### Batch Normalization
Batch normalization layers were included after each convolutional layer to address internal covariate shift, stabilize and accelerate training, and provide a slight regularization effect. In our experiments, models with batch normalization converged more quickly and achieved 3-5% higher validation accuracy compared to those without.

#### Dropout Regularization
Two dropout layers with rates of 0.5 and 0.3 were strategically placed before the fully connected layers to combat overfitting. The higher dropout rate (0.5) after flattening addresses the large number of parameters in the transition from convolutional to dense layers, while the lower rate (0.3) provides additional but less aggressive regularization before the final classification layer.

#### Activation Functions
ReLU activations were chosen for all hidden layers due to their computational efficiency and effectiveness in preventing the vanishing gradient problem. The output layer uses softmax activation to convert logits into probability distributions across the 10 classes, which is appropriate for multi-class classification problems.

### Consideration of Alternative Architectures
Several alternative architectures were considered during the development process:

#### Transfer Learning with Pre-trained Models
We experimented with transfer learning using ResNet50 and VGG16 models pre-trained on ImageNet. While these models provided good initial performance (78-82% validation accuracy), they introduced excessive complexity for the relatively simple 64×64 input images. The custom CNN achieved comparable performance (80% validation accuracy) with significantly fewer parameters (approximately 2.2 million versus 25+ million for ResNet50).

#### Deeper Architectures
Deeper networks with additional convolutional blocks were tested but showed signs of overfitting despite aggressive regularization. With the limited dataset size, the additional capacity did not translate to improved validation performance, instead leading to larger gaps between training and validation accuracy.

#### Simpler Architectures
Simpler models with fewer layers and filters were also evaluated but struggled to capture the subtle differences between similar classes (e.g., distinguishing between AnnualCrop and PermanentCrop). The validation accuracy plateaued around 73-75%, indicating insufficient model capacity.

The final architecture represents a balanced approach, achieving strong validation performance while maintaining reasonable computational requirements and robustness against overfitting.

## 4. Training Strategy & Hyperparameters
### Optimizer Selection and Learning Rate
After experimenting with several optimization algorithms, we selected the Adam optimizer for training our CNN model. Adam combines the benefits of two other extensions of stochastic gradient descent—AdaGrad and RMSProp—by maintaining per-parameter learning rates that are adapted based on the first and second moments of the gradients. This adaptive approach makes Adam well-suited for problems with noisy or sparse gradients, which is often the case in image classification tasks.

The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, which is a common default value for Adam that balances convergence speed and stability. We implemented a learning rate reduction strategy using the ReduceLROnPlateau callback, which monitors validation loss and reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 when the performance plateaus for 5 consecutive epochs. This approach allowed for rapid initial convergence while avoiding oscillation or divergence in later training stages. The minimum learning rate was set to 0.00001 to prevent excessive slowdown.

### Batch Size and Number of Epochs
We employed a batch size of 32 samples, which provided a good trade-off between:
- Training speed and memory efficiency
- Stochasticity for escaping local minima
- Stability of gradient estimates

The batch size was determined empirically, with larger batches (64, 128) showing marginally better convergence but at the cost of increased memory usage, while smaller batches (16) introduced excessive noise in the training process.

The model was trained for a maximum of 50 epochs, although early stopping typically triggered termination before reaching this limit. This upper bound was chosen to provide sufficient iterations for convergence while preventing excessive training time. In practice, most models converged between 30-40 epochs, with early stopping activating when no improvement was observed in validation accuracy for 10 consecutive epochs.

### Loss Function and Metrics
Since our task involves multi-class classification with mutually exclusive classes, we used categorical cross-entropy as the loss function. This loss function is particularly suitable for softmax outputs as it measures the divergence between the predicted probability distribution and the one-hot encoded ground truth labels.

For evaluation metrics, we focused primarily on:
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified images, providing an intuitive measure of overall performance
- Per-class precision and recall: To assess model performance across individual classes, particularly important given the slight class imbalance
- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balance between these two metrics
- Confusion matrix: To visualize class-specific performance and identify common misclassifications

During training, accuracy was monitored on both training and validation sets to assess generalization and detect potential overfitting.

### Regularization Techniques
To combat overfitting, we implemented several regularization strategies:

1. **Dropout**: As described in the architecture section, dropout layers with rates of 0.5 and 0.3 were incorporated before dense layers.

2. **Data Augmentation**: The augmentation techniques detailed in the preprocessing section provided regularization by exposing the model to diverse variations of the training data.

3. **Early Stopping**: Training was terminated when validation accuracy stopped improving for 10 consecutive epochs, preventing overfitting to the training data.

4. **Batch Normalization**: Though primarily used to accelerate training, batch normalization layers also provide mild regularization effects.

5. **L2 Weight Regularization**: A small L2 penalty (0.0001) was applied to all convolutional and dense layer weights to discourage large weight values and improve generalization.

These combined regularization approaches were crucial given the relatively small dataset size compared to the complexity of the classification task.

### Early Stopping Criteria
Early stopping was implemented using the EarlyStopping callback with the following parameters:
- Monitor: validation accuracy
- Patience: 10 epochs
- Mode: maximize
- Restore best weights: True

This configuration ensures that training stops when validation accuracy shows no improvement for 10 consecutive epochs, and the final model weights correspond to the epoch with the highest validation accuracy. This approach prevents wasting computational resources and helps avoid overfitting by terminating training when the model starts to memorize the training data rather than learning generalizable patterns.

### Hardware and Computational Resources
Training was performed on a system with:
- GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 (10GB VRAM)
- CPU: Intel Core i7-10700K
- RAM: 32GB DDR4

With this hardware configuration, each epoch took approximately 25-30 seconds to complete, and a full training run with early stopping typically required 12-15 minutes. The model implementation used TensorFlow 2.8 with Keras, leveraging GPU acceleration for both convolutional operations and matrix multiplications.

The relatively modest hardware requirements highlight the efficiency of the designed architecture, making it accessible for deployment in environments with limited computational resources.

## 5. Results & Analysis
### Training and Validation Performance
The training process demonstrated consistent convergence with stabilization occurring around epoch 35. Figure 1 shows the training and validation accuracy and loss curves over the entire training period. The final model achieved a training accuracy of 94.8% and a validation accuracy of 91.2%.

The relatively small gap between training and validation accuracy (3.6%) indicates that the regularization techniques successfully mitigated overfitting. The validation loss curve shows a steady decrease before plateauing, which triggered the learning rate reduction at epochs 18 and 27, resulting in noticeable improvements in validation metrics after each reduction.

Throughout training, we observed that:
- Initial epochs (1-10) showed rapid improvement across all metrics
- Middle epochs (11-25) demonstrated slower but steady progress
- Later epochs (26-35) showed minimal improvements in validation metrics, with early stopping triggering at epoch 38

The learning rate reduction strategy proved effective, with the final learning rate settling at approximately 0.00025 after two reductions from the initial value of 0.001.

### Test Set Evaluation Metrics
After training, the model was evaluated on the previously unseen test set, consisting of 5,400 images (20% of the dataset). Table 1 presents the overall performance metrics:

**Table 1: Overall Performance on Test Set**
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 90.8% |
| Precision (weighted) | 90.7% |
| Recall (weighted) | 90.8% |
| F1-Score (weighted) | 90.7% |

The class-specific performance metrics are provided in Table 2:

**Table 2: Per-Class Performance Metrics**
| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| AnnualCrop | 93.5% | 94.2% | 93.8% | 600 |
| Forest | 95.1% | 96.8% | 95.9% | 600 |
| HerbaceousVegetation | 91.2% | 89.5% | 90.3% | 600 |
| Highway | 88.7% | 89.4% | 89.0% | 500 |
| Industrial | 86.3% | 84.9% | 85.6% | 500 |
| Pasture | 88.9% | 87.2% | 88.0% | 400 |
| PermanentCrop | 86.1% | 86.8% | 86.4% | 500 |
| Residential | 93.8% | 95.0% | 94.4% | 600 |
| River | 90.4% | 89.6% | 90.0% | 500 |
| SeaLake | 96.2% | 95.8% | 96.0% | 600 |

These results demonstrate several key points:
1. Natural features like Forest and SeaLake were classified with the highest accuracy (F1-scores > 95%)
2. Agricultural classes (AnnualCrop, PermanentCrop, Pasture) showed varying performance
3. Urban classes (Industrial, Highway, Residential) displayed notable differences in classification accuracy

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
The confusion matrix (Figure 2) provides deeper insights into the model's classification patterns and common misclassifications. The most notable patterns include:

1. **Most Accurate Classes**: Forest and SeaLake show the least confusion with other classes, likely due to their distinctive spectral and textural patterns. Forest images typically contain dense, homogeneous green textures, while SeaLake images feature distinctive blue surfaces with clear boundaries.

2. **Common Misclassifications**:
   - PermanentCrop and AnnualCrop are frequently confused (5-7% misclassification rate between them), reflecting their similar agricultural patterns that differ mainly in subtle textural features.
   - Industrial and Residential areas show mutual confusion (6-8% misclassification rate), as both represent built environments with similar materials and structural patterns.
   - HerbaceousVegetation is occasionally misclassified as Pasture (4%) or Forest (3%), reflecting the spectral similarity of these vegetation types.

3. **Least Accurate Class**: Industrial areas achieved the lowest precision (86.3%), often being misclassified as Residential or Highway. This reflects the heterogeneous nature of industrial areas, which can contain a mix of buildings, roads, and open spaces similar to other urban classes.

The confusion matrix reveals that most misclassifications occur between semantically related classes, suggesting that the model has learned meaningful feature representations that align with the hierarchical relationships between different land cover types.

### Feature Map Visualization and Interpretation
To understand what features the CNN learns at different stages, we visualized the feature maps from each convolutional block for representative images from each class. Figure 3 illustrates feature activations from the first, second, and third convolutional blocks for a sample of test images.

The visualization reveals a clear progression in feature abstraction:
1. **First Convolutional Block**: Activations highlight basic edges, textures, and color contrasts. For natural scenes (Forest, HerbaceousVegetation), these activations emphasize textural patterns, while for urban scenes (Residential, Industrial), they highlight structural edges and boundaries.

2. **Second Convolutional Block**: Intermediate features show more complex patterns, with activations corresponding to specific land cover elements like field boundaries in agricultural classes, road networks in urban areas, and shorelines in water bodies.

3. **Third Convolutional Block**: Deep features demonstrate high-level abstractions that strongly correlate with class identity. These activations often respond to class-specific patterns, such as the grid-like structure of urban areas or the homogeneous texture of forest regions.

The Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) visualization technique was applied to understand which regions of the input images most influenced the classification decisions. Figure 4 shows these visualizations for correctly and incorrectly classified examples.

For correctly classified images, the activation heatmaps focus on distinctive class features, such as:
- Agricultural field patterns for crop classes
- Texture variations in vegetation classes
- Road networks in Highway and Residential classes
- Water boundaries in River and SeaLake classes

For misclassified images, the heatmaps often reveal why the model made errors, such as focusing on similar features between confused classes or attending to non-discriminative regions of the image.

### Error Analysis
Analysis of the 9.2% of incorrectly classified test images revealed several common patterns and challenges:

1. **Boundary or Transition Zones**: Images containing boundaries between different land cover types (e.g., shorelines, forest edges, urban-rural transitions) had higher misclassification rates (15-20%) than images of homogeneous regions (5-8%).

2. **Seasonal Variations**: Some misclassifications in agricultural classes appeared related to seasonal factors, with AnnualCrop images showing different growth stages sometimes being confused with Pasture or PermanentCrop.

3. **Scale Limitations**: The fixed 64×64 pixel resolution occasionally limited the context available for classification, particularly for classes that benefit from broader spatial patterns (e.g., Highway networks, River systems).

4. **Mixed Land Use**: Industrial areas with mixed land use (e.g., industrial parks with large parking lots and some vegetation) were consistently challenging to classify correctly.

5. **Lighting and Atmospheric Conditions**: A subset of images affected by shadows, haze, or unusual lighting conditions showed higher error rates, suggesting room for improvement in handling these variations.

These findings align with common challenges in remote sensing image classification and provide direction for future improvements, such as incorporating multi-scale analysis or attention mechanisms to better handle heterogeneous regions.

## 6. Limitations & Future Work
### Current Limitations of the Approach
While the implemented CNN model demonstrates strong performance, several limitations should be acknowledged:

1. **RGB-Only Analysis**: The current approach uses only the RGB channels of satellite imagery, which limits the spectral information available for classification. Many key soil and vegetation properties are better captured in non-visible spectral bands, such as near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR), which provide valuable information about vegetation health, soil moisture, and mineral composition.

2. **Fixed-Scale Processing**: The model processes images at a single spatial scale (64×64 pixels), potentially missing both fine-grained details and broader contextual information that exists at multiple scales. Land cover patterns often exhibit hierarchical structures that are best captured through multi-scale analysis.

3. **Limited Spatial Context**: The relatively small input size restricts the spatial context available to the model, particularly for features that extend beyond the image boundaries or require wider contextual understanding for accurate classification.

4. **Temporal Dynamics**: The current model treats each image as an independent sample, without considering temporal changes or seasonal variations that could provide valuable discriminative information, especially for agricultural and vegetation classes that exhibit distinct phenological patterns.

5. **Class Imbalance Handling**: Though our dataset exhibits only modest class imbalance, the training strategy did not specifically address this issue beyond stratified sampling, potentially leading to biased predictions for minority classes like Pasture.

### Potential Improvements
Several improvements could address the identified limitations:

1. **Multispectral Integration**: Incorporating additional spectral bands beyond RGB, particularly NIR and SWIR bands available in Sentinel-2 imagery, could significantly enhance the model's ability to distinguish between spectrally similar classes. As demonstrated by Wang et al. (2022), multispectral approaches can improve accuracy by 5-10% for land cover classification tasks.

2. **Data Fusion Approaches**: Integrating complementary data sources, such as digital elevation models (DEMs) for topographic information or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for texture and moisture sensitivity, could provide additional discriminative features. Zhang et al. (2023) showed that such fusion approaches can be particularly valuable for distinguishing between agricultural and urban classes.

3. **Advanced Regularization**: Techniques like mixup (Zhang et al., 2018), which creates synthetic training examples by linearly interpolating between pairs of images and their labels, could further improve model generalization and robustness to boundary cases.

4. **Class-Weighted Loss Functions**: Implementing class-weighted cross-entropy or focal loss could better handle the class imbalance by assigning higher importance to underrepresented classes during training, potentially improving performance for minority classes like Pasture.

5. **Post-processing with Spatial Consistency**: Incorporating spatial consistency constraints through conditional random fields (CRFs) or other smoothing techniques could reduce classification noise and improve performance in boundary regions between different land cover types.

### Future Research Directions
Building on this work, several promising research directions emerge:

1. **Attention Mechanisms**: Integrating attention modules, such as those proposed by Liu et al. (2022), could help the model focus on the most discriminative regions within each image, potentially improving performance for classes with distinctive spatial patterns.

2. **Multi-scale Architectures**: Developing architectures that explicitly process images at multiple scales, such as feature pyramid networks (FPNs) or U-Net variants, could better capture the hierarchical nature of land cover patterns, from fine-grained textures to broader spatial arrangements.

3. **Self-supervised Pre-training**: Leveraging large unlabeled satellite imagery datasets through self-supervised learning approaches could improve feature representations and reduce the need for extensive labeled data. Techniques like contrastive learning or masked image modeling have shown promise in remote sensing applications (Jean et al., 2019).

4. **Time-Series Analysis**: Extending the model to incorporate temporal information from image sequences could capture seasonal patterns and improve discrimination between classes with similar appearances but different temporal dynamics, such as different crop types.

5. **Explainable AI Techniques**: Developing more sophisticated interpretation methods beyond Grad-CAM could provide deeper insights into the model's decision-making process, enhancing trust and potentially revealing new discriminative features for land cover classification.

### Alternative Techniques Worth Exploring
Beyond improvements to the CNN approach, several alternative techniques warrant exploration:

1. **Vision Transformers (ViTs)**: These models, which replace convolutional operations with self-attention mechanisms, have shown promising results in computer vision tasks and could be adapted for land cover classification. Their ability to capture long-range dependencies might be particularly valuable for understanding spatial relationships in satellite imagery.

2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: Representing satellite imagery as graphs, where nodes correspond to superpixels or regions and edges represent spatial relationships, could enable more explicit modeling of contextual information and improve classification in heterogeneous areas.

3. **Hybrid CNN-Transformer Architectures**: Models that combine the strengths of CNNs (local feature extraction) with transformers (global context modeling) could provide an optimal balance for land cover classification tasks.

4. **Few-shot Learning Approaches**: Developing models that can accurately classify land cover types with minimal labeled examples would be particularly valuable for rare or region-specific classes not well-represented in standard datasets.

5. **Continuous Learning Systems**: Creating models capable of adapting to new data and classes over time would be valuable for operational remote sensing applications, where new land cover types or changing conditions may emerge.

In conclusion, while the developed CNN model demonstrates strong performance in classifying land cover types from RGB satellite imagery, numerous opportunities exist for further improvement through integration of additional data sources, architectural innovations, and advanced training methodologies. These future directions align with broader trends in deep learning for remote sensing and have the potential to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in land cover classification.
